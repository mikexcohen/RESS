Rhythmic entrainment source separation

This is the code that accompanies the paper "Rhythmic entrainment source separation: Optimizing analyses of neural responses to
rhythmic sensory stimulation" (http://mikexcohen.com/data/Cohen_RESS.pdf)

NOTE: The online sample code includes a datafile that is too big to post here (630 MB). If you want to try the code on the sample data, please download it from https://osf.io/3qbxw/ (posted by coauthor Rasa Gulbinaite).
